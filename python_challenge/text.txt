In
using
the
triple
bottom
line
analysis
method,
our
team
was
able
to
conduct
sufficient
research
to
come
to
a
recommendation
in
stovetop
technology
for
the
food
service
needs
of
the
new
Student
Union
Building.
By
breaking
down
each
major
area
of
consideration
we
were
able
to
see
which
technology
was
favourable
in
each
branch
of
the
analysis.
While
it
was
concluded
through
extensive
economic
modelling
that
natural
gas
ranges
would
be
the
cheaper
technology,
the
environmental
analysis
and
social
analysis
both
leaned
towards
induction
stovetop
technology
as
the
more
favourable
option.
Implementation
of
Induction
technology
would
yield
lower
long
term
emissions
when
compared
to
gas
range
technology,
as
well
as
offer
significant
safety
and
practicality
benefits
to
cooks.
Based
on
our
research
it
was
concluded
that
the
increased
costs
associated
with
induction
stovetops
would
be
justified
by
the
environmental
and
social
benefits
offered
by
the
technology.
